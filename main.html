            <h2>Arduino IDE</h2>
            <p>I worked on a line-following robot project using Arduino-based robotics. The robot uses infrared sensors to detect the contrast between a black line and a white surface, and follows the line using geared DC motors controlled by an Arduino board and motor driver. I wrote code in the Arduino IDE to control the motors and interpret the sensor readings. The line-following robot is a fun and challenging project that showcases the capabilities of the Arduino board and provides an introduction to robotics.
